.ktr files are pentaho data integration (kettle) files. The platform can be downloaded here --> 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Data%20Integration/

It's a fantasic tool for pulling different data sources and performing analysis. The above .ktr shows a quick example of the things you can do with kettle. I used divvy (bike share in chicago) data stored in a zipped file. The data is pulled directly from the zipped file and merged with another stream that is pulling live JSON data from the web. There are several pentaho tools used for sorting, ranking, filtering, aggregating and even a little javascript.
