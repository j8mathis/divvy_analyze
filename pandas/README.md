## Divvy Analyze

This is equivalent to the penatho example [here](https://github.com/j8mathis/samples/tree/master/pentaho/divvy) only in python. To summarize what this does: 

* Get data from http end point
* Pull data from compressed folder
* Create data frames and join them together
* Run a few different aggregations on the combined data


## Setup

I used pipenv for this project. The following snippets can get this started

```python
pip install pipenv #install pipenv if you don't have it
pipenv install #install packages from the Pipfile
pipenv shell #activate the pipenv shell

```
